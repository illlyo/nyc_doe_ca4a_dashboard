The team has felt it has been challenging to keep up (particularly with FAFSA's October start date. \n\nThis lead to a conversation around how to improve strategies for the work that happens in the spring of junior year (i.e. Starting common ap in Junior year so that students are better prepared to apply in the fall). \n\nWhile, the team acknowledges that CUNY applications are going as expected (about the same or better than last year). They expressed concerns around manpower and level of support provided around common ap and financial aid. \n\nFurther, there were 36 students with an 80 or above that had not applied. We discussed the importance of the team learning more from those students what has interfered with their application process. \n\nThere are ongoing concerns around time and space.\n\nJohn Adams is hosting College Awareness Day \n\nSetting up tables in the cafeteria during lunch - posters, videos, giveaways. Encouraging application completion. Handing out invitations to complete CUNY (before Feb 1), \n\nInterest in establishing ongoing partnerships with certification programs at CUNY. \nLearned about Helena Rubinstein Scholarship for certification programs. \n\nCareer Exploration Month \nFebruary 9th graders will all be engaging with Naviance. Learning how to register for their accounts. (Will attempt to connect them with the opportunity being offered by Liz for support around Naviance implementation. \n\nFollowup with English AP (who is on board) - determination to be made how many lessons (Career, Interest profiler)  \n\nIn addition the team will distribute passes for regent's week to push the CUNY application (and other ap completion). \n\nThere is also a consideration to bring students to the Summer Enrichment Fair",

This allows them to see how this work, not only aims to better prepare them on their postsecondary pathways, but also connects them to the thousands of other students across the city whose lives will be transformed by this shared mission.  \n\n2.\tÒItÕs totally acceptable for students to engage in a modified Socratic Seminar.  ItÕs about the activities that best support student academic skill progress, not about staying true to the technique or approach.Ó\n Ð Brooklyn Academy\n\n3.\tIn order to help promote and monitor engagement in student-centered discussion and self/peer assessment, try no-tech formative assessment strategies (e.g., mini dry-erase paddles, Thumb-Hand-Stand, 4-corners, colored signals, etc.)\n\n\nB.\t In addition, the team noted that they will address the following priorities: \n\n1.\t Before our March session:  Update the teamÕs learning trajectory, which documents the teamÕs plan and process.  In each monthly box, type in the Òbroad strokesÓ of the teamÕs work (planning/refinement sessions, implementation, inquiry sessions, intervisitation, etc.).\n\n2.\tTomlin and Newmark will continue to test out rubric, record/discuss findings, and make adjustments.

This allows them to see how this work, not only aims to better prepare them on their postsecondary pathways, but also connects them to the thousands of other students across the city whose lives will be transformed by this shared mission.  \n\n2.\tÒItÕs totally acceptable for students to engage in a modified Socratic Seminar.  ItÕs about the activities that best support student academic skill progress, not about staying true to the technique or approach.Ó\n Ð Brooklyn Academy\n\n3.\tIn order to help promote and monitor engagement in student-centered discussion and self/peer assessment, try no-tech formative assessment strategies (e.g., mini dry-erase paddles, Thumb-Hand-Stand, 4-corners, colored signals, etc.)\n\n\nB.\t In addition, the team noted that they will address the following priorities: \n\n1.\t Before our March session:  Update the teamÕs learning trajectory, which documents the teamÕs plan and process.  In each monthly box, type in the Òbroad strokesÓ of the teamÕs work (planning/refinement sessions, implementation, inquiry sessions, intervisitation, etc.).\n\n2.\tTomlin and Newmark will continue to test out rubric, record/discuss findings, and make adjustments. ÊCampbell and Newmark will visit at least one of TomlinÕs classes. ÊTomlin will visit at least one of NewmarkÕs classes.  Campbell, Newmark, and Tomlin will take low inference notes during classroom visits.\n\n3.\t Team meets to discuss feedback from classroom visits and rubric revisions.\n\n4.\tContinue to update the resources folder as the Socractic Seminar prototype is developed/refined.\n\n\n5.\t Continue to reach out to Ms. Grunin for additional support/feedback as needed.  As requested, Grunin has left feedback on the Revised Socractic Seminar Goal Sheet.\n\nNote:  All CA4A documents/resources for the team can be found in the Bedford Stuyvesant Prep CA4A Documentation Folder\n\n\n\nMs. Grunin will\n\n¥\tOngoing:  Support team in change project planning and implementation and collaborate in inquiry sessions to review and evaluate progress of the plan, determine modifications, and outline next steps to improve student outcomes.\n\nNote:  Ms. Grunin will schedule a February phone call with the team to plan for the March inquiry session.",

He discussed that many of our initiatives will support some students along the way to get a CDOS Commencement Credential and he will follow up with the committee with standards.\n¥\tWe went over the Freshman Year CA4A suggested standards sheet and went over what we do, what we would like to do and what we would like to move forward to sophomore year.\n¥\tReviewed past months.  English and Guidance lessons went off as planned.  Social Studies has not gone yet.  Ms. X said that Ms. Hahl gave a college related assignment over break that may count for this initiative.  Ms. S will follow up with her.  \n¥\tMr. N created and began implementation of the January Science lesson on STEM careers. He has shared this lesson plan with Ms. Somrah and Ms. Pappas.  They will also be starting this lesson plan.  Mr. N will follow up with them.\n¥\tMs. X shared the googledoc 9-question freshman baseline survey with Mr. Castellano and Ms. Leto.  She will encourage them to complete with their classes tomorrow.  \n¥\tWe discussed March Madness and how to implement.  Prevailing idea is to have each class named a college.  These names will be posted in a bracket in the hallway.  Each class will compete with one thing each week of March: Math Regents Questions, Attendance, Foul Shots/or hoops in a minute, College Quiz/Gameshow.  Winning class gets a party and top players in each class get a prize possibly if we can work out the logistics.  We will need a full plan by next meeting. \nTo Do: \nMs. X will f/u with Mr. C, Ms. L and Mr. Panepinto as needed to ensure survey is completed tomorrow.\nMr. N will f/u with Ms. S and Ms. P re: his lesson plan.\nMs. S will f/u with Ms. H to discuss her holiday break lesson plan and f/u with Ms. DÕAntone to see if any Math assignment went out.\nFor ALL: copy you time sheets when submitted to Mr. Hurych so Ms. S can monitor our spending accordingly.  Please be sure to punch out for creating lesson plans as well.  You can get 1-2 hours for each lesson plan.",
