# College Access For All - Dashboard App

This dashboard app collects data entered by coaches and returns chart reports containing data visualization. It also contains an Admin's path with complete authorization to create/edit/update/destroy data in the database. The database is created into a RESTful API and is proxy'ed with the front-end page.

Client work was done for the NYC Department of Education
